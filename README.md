## 📊 Model Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Preprocessed dataset to remove missing or irrelevant values.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Encoded categorical features and scaled numerical ones.  
3. **Model Training** – Used regression models (like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) for price prediction.  
4. **Evaluation** – Tested and validated the model for accuracy and performance.  
5. **Deployment** – Deployed the trained model using Streamlit.
